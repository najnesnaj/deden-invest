<h1>About</h1>
<p>Investing in emerging markets is not as straightforward as one might think.
The only way is up? Not reallyâ€¦</p>
<p>Emerging markets can be compared to America before 1900. (idea : Mark Faber)</p>
<p>A lot of boom and bust, and signs of globalisation.
English investors withdrawing money for other purposes.</p>
<p>After reading quite a few books on investing, I have become convinced that the stock exchange can generate a return, but not all the time.</p>
<p>I think there are seasons. So you seed and harvest, but in the correct season.</p>
<p>Most small time investors like myself end up in losing money,</p>
<p>This book is automatically generated from Jupyter notebooks that capture realtime (up to date) data from the internet.</p>
<p>The purpose is not a weatherforcast but a season-detection, which could support investment decisions.</p>
