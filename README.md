This repository is a tribute to Anthony Deden.

Tony Deden is the Chairman of Edelweiss Holdings, first launched as a fund in 2002. After building a remarkable track record, Tony converted Edelweiss into a holding company with over $300 million in assets and holdings that range from branded dairy products to a fragrance company and a salmon farm. Tony prizes safety of capital above all else and has structured Edelweiss to survive any type of economic situation.


### Investment Philosophy

- Never lose money
- Use inflation as a benchmark 

### Portfolio

Build an all-weather-portfolio, which can survive different market conditions.

- no debt (so no bonds, junk bonds, ....)
- keep it real (no empty growth promesses, but real value) 
- diversify and rebalance
- gold/commodities, is an important asset but not at any price

### Market timing

You cannot time the market, but you need to be aware when risk is high.
I strongly believe in market cycles and reverting to the mean. 
Buy low and sell high. You do not need to be invested all the time.

### Tools
As an individual investor you need to be aware of your position. 

- What are other value investors / insiders doing? 
- When is something cheap or expensive?
- What is happening in the market?

### This project:

The purpose of this project is to : 
- monitor market risk (country report) 
- analyse pricing of certain assets (buy/sell advise)
- benchmark own portfolio

### documentation
