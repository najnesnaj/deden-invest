GARP: Growth at a Reasonable Price
############################################################################

this is an American EFT which tracks small cap value internationally: 
https://us.dimensional.com/funds/international-small-cap-value

## Filtering ##

- first raw filter gets 3000 lines which sometimes contain name of company.

- next we need to link a ticker symbol to the name

- as a proof of concept I've used Belgium based companies

## Criteria ##

- P/E ratios that are below both their historical earnings growth and their forecast earnings growth

- low debt

- has to be around for some time (statistics)

- the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio 
(P/B ratios under 1 are typically considered solid investments)

- EPS (earnings per share)

- earnings estimate

### note ###

  
Suppose there would be a 100 dollarbill on the pavement.
Would you pick it up?

According to efficientmarkettheory it would not be lying there.

Maybe small value stock markets ain't that efficient ...
